**JShell** is a **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** tool introduced in **Java 9** to provide an interactive environment for writing, evaluating, and testing Java code snippets. It allows developers to interact with the Java language without the need to compile and run entire programs, making it easier to experiment with code and learn Java.

### 1. **What is JShell?**
JShell is a command-line tool that provides a **Java REPL**. You can enter Java expressions, statements, or method definitions into JShell, and it evaluates them immediately, providing the result without needing to write a full program.

**Key features of JShell:**
- **Interactive Environment**: It allows you to execute code line-by-line and immediately see the results.
- **Useful for Learning**: JShell is great for new developers to learn Java as it doesn't require writing full class structures or dealing with boilerplate code.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Developers can use JShell for quick prototyping, testing small code snippets, and debugging logic without having to create full-fledged Java classes or projects.

### 2. **What is REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)?**
**REPL** stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It is an interactive programming environment that takes user input (read), evaluates the input (eval), prints the result (print), and then repeats the process (loop).

In a REPL:
- **Read**: The user types in a code statement or expression.
- **Eval**: The system interprets or compiles and executes the statement.
- **Print**: The result of the execution is displayed to the user.
- **Loop**: This cycle continues until the user terminates it.

### 3. **How JShell Works (Interactive REPL Loop)**
JShell follows the REPL cycle:

- **Read**: You enter a Java statement, expression, or declaration.
    ```java
    int x = 10;
    ```
  
- **Evaluate**: JShell evaluates the statement.
  
- **Print**: JShell prints the result or acknowledges the assignment.
    ```java
    x ==> 10
    ```
  
- **Loop**: You can continue entering more expressions and JShell will keep evaluating and printing results.

### 4. **Common JShell Use Cases**

#### a. **Evaluating Expressions**
You can enter basic Java expressions, and JShell will immediately evaluate them:
```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
a + b;
```
Output:
```java
15
```

#### b. **Defining Methods**
JShell allows you to define methods and use them immediately:
```java
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
add(3, 4);
```
Output:
```java
7
```

#### c. **Exploring APIs**
You can quickly test standard or third-party APIs to understand how they work without creating a whole Java project:
```java
String str = "Hello World";
str.toUpperCase();
```
Output:
```java
"HELLO WORLD"
```

#### d. **Prototyping Code**
For fast code prototyping and testing algorithms:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + i);
}
```

#### e. **Exploring Java Features**
JShell is especially useful for exploring new Java features, such as testing new APIs or syntax introduced in recent versions of Java.

### 5. **JShell Commands**
JShell has several built-in commands (prefixed by `/`) to manage sessions, variables, and other aspects of the environment:
- **`/list`**: Lists all code entered in the session.
- **`/vars`**: Shows declared variables.
- **`/methods`**: Displays all declared methods.
- **`/edit`**: Allows you to edit a previous snippet.
- **`/exit`**: Exits JShell.

### 6. **Advantages of Using JShell**
- **Instant Feedback**: JShell allows for immediate feedback on code execution, making it faster to experiment and debug.
- **No Boilerplate Code**: Unlike typical Java programs that require classes and methods, JShell removes the need for boilerplate code, letting you focus directly on the logic.
- **Testing Code Snippets**: Itâ€™s ideal for quickly testing small code snippets or learning new Java concepts.
- **Learning Tool**: JShell is a great tool for beginners to learn Java as they can immediately see the output of their code.

### 7. **Starting JShell**
You can start JShell from the terminal or command prompt by typing `jshell`. Once started, you can interactively enter and execute Java code.

Example:
```bash
$ jshell
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.2
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> int x = 10;
x ==> 10

jshell> System.out.println(x * 2);
20
```

### 8. **Limitations**
- **Not for Full Application Development**: JShell is intended for quick experimentation, not for writing complete Java applications.
- **Temporary State**: The state in JShell is ephemeral. Once you exit the session, all variables and method definitions are lost unless explicitly saved.

### Summary
**JShell** is an interactive Java REPL that enables quick experimentation and learning. It simplifies testing Java code snippets by providing an environment where you can execute code line-by-line and immediately view the results without setting up a complete Java project.
